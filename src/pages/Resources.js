      Looks like you want to create your very own course on Peace Antz Academy! Although teaching a course can be inimidating, it is one of the best ways to learn.
      <Box sx={{ marginTop: 2 }}>

        Here are the steps you need to take to create your course:
          <ol>
            <li>If you have a syllabus already, then have it ready in .pdf format. Otherwise you can use <Link href="https://chat.openai.com/" target="_blank">ChatGPT</Link>, <Link href="https://www.bing.com/search?q=Bing+AI&showconv=1&FORM=hpcodx" target="_blank">Bing Chat</Link> our your favorite AI tool to create a syllabus. </li>
            <li>On the Courses page, click on the "Create Course" button on the top right of the page and confirm this transaction.</li>
            <li>Once the newly created course appears on the Courses page (may take a few minutes), you need to initialize the course by clicking the button ASAP and confirm that as well</li>
            <li>After the course is initialized, the card will change and you should see a button that says "Input Course Details". Click on that to open the window to put in the course information.</li>
            <li>Determine the Title and write a short course description for what you are going to teach.<p>TIP: Know your sponsor, create a course in some skill that people need.</p></li>
            <li>Estimate the amount of hours time commitment the course will be and what the starting date and time will be.</li>
            <li>Set the amount your would like to get (in MATIC) sponsored to teach the course. You may self-sponsor your own course if needed.</li>
            <li>Upload the syllabus in .pdf format and a course image (16:9 aspect ratio) to show off your course and show students what they are signing up for!</li>
            <li>Once the course has been fully sponsored you can start the course. Best to wait until the start date to allow students to enroll. Once the course is started, funds get locked until you pass/fail the students.</li>
            <li>In order to collect your payment, you have to pass at least one student.</li>
            <li>To pass a student click on the "Pass/Fail/Claim Payment" button and the click the "Pass Student" button next to the addresses you wish to pass.</li>
            <li>If the student does not pass the class, you can boot them by clicking the "Fail Student" button. You will have a list you can copy for airdropping rewards/certificates!</li>
            <li>Once you have passed or failed all the students you can click the "Claim Payout" button.</li>
